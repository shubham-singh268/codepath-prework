**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: Shubham Singh

Time spent: 8 hours spent in total

Link to project: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/shubham-268-light-sound-memory-game?path=script.js%3A1%3A0

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [YES] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [YES] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [YES] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [YES] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [YES] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [YES] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [YES] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [YES] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
I have completely used the resources provided to me by the codepath glitch project guide.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
Since I am new to Java scripting and CSS. I wouldn't say there was any difficulty in learning the new ideas; rather, I loved learning something new, which I always admire.
I particularly appreciate how the functions and parameters used in script.js to incorporate the game's start/stop and guessing algorithm were implemented. Initially, I anticipated that this would take a significant amount of time.
But I was able to finish and learn the code in around 5 - 6 hours. The scope of HTML and CSS will be quite broad in the future since there are several applications that require changes, and I believe that will be beneficial in eradicating errors and improving the user interface on the web.

Finally, converting the video to GIF was a tricky and relatively new thing for me, but the tutorial was excellent and I got it in a matter of a few minutes.
I attempted to export the glitch project to GITHUB, but I made a mistake that cost me 9 hours of my effort. I exported using shortcut (ctrl+shift+E), but before that I had to authorize glitch and then export.
It took less than a minute to finish the procedure after the authorisation. 

Overall, I loved working on the project, and I am really interested in participating in this internship to improve my web development abilities and become a skilled web developer.


3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I am currently in the learning phase, and I am eager to acquire additional tactics and principles for completing assignments. I'm particularly curious on how the CSS, HTML, and Java script interact in the memory game implementation.
I realize that they each play a different role in game design, but how do these three frontend web development frameworks collaborate?

I'd also like to learn more about bootstaping, Angular JS, and React JS. I'm also curious about how Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning can speed up application development and, eventually, how progressive web applications will replace native mobile apps.
Voice search will expand as a result of IoT.


4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I'd want to rework the functions as well as add extra features. I'd like to make the game more elaborative, in that after the user wins, I'll ask whether user wants to play more rounds by adding more light and music boxes to the game. Then I may expand the number of possible guesses. i.e. If the user selects an incorrect guess, he or she will have two additional chances to predict the pattern and proceed. I want to include numbers in the middle of the box so that if the user is colorblind, he or she can memorize the pattern with the numbers and predict the correct box sequence.
